## GeospatialMojo 🌍🔥

Dedicated to **geospatial**🌍 packages written in the [Mojo programming language](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/)🔥.

### Plans
- [ ] Rewrite the popular [PROJ](https://proj.org/) library in Mojo for better memory safety and parallelization, using [pyproj](https://github.com/pyproj4/pyproj) as an inspiration and starting point.
- [ ] Add **geometry** tools like those used in [shapely](https://github.com/shapely/shapely).
- [ ] Add terrain analysis tools, such as slope, aspect, hillshade, viewshed analysis, etc.
